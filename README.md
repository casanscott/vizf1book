**Visualizing Formula Data in R**

by Casan Scott

The overarching goal of the book is to provide a gentle introduction to analyzing Formula 1 data using the R programming language. It includes some brief commentary on the sport of Formula 1, lots of data visualizations, and R code used to create each plot. While this book is *primarily* written for people interested in data visualization using the R programming language, I do hope that some of the nerdier Formula 1 fans will find these data visualizations interesting.
